# Project Blueberry

The Blueberry project is an experimental initiative spearheaded by Blue Robotics to explore a new vehicle architecture for component and software connectivity. This will leverage ethernet connectivity for all components, making the vehicle essentially an ethernet subnet connected to the top-end laptop via an ethernet connection over G.hn. The vehicle components will interface either through 10Base-T1S, 100Base-T or Gigabit ethernet depending on their type.

This project encompasses connectors, hardware, firmware, communication protocols and software elements to achieve a richer vehicle telemetry and control and facilitate a greatly improved user experience. The goal is to achieve a fully open-source solution, leveraging existing, proven open-source projects wherever appropriate.

This is not ready for prime-time yet!
